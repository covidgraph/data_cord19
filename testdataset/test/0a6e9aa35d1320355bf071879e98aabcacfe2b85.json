News reports and case reports often play an important role in policy decisions, because decision makers, including those in the general public, often do not have the time, ability, or expertise to access and synthesize the evidence from high-quality studies. For example, in 1999, the newspaper USA Today published the following health-related headlines: \"'Scars' May Be Cancer Predictor,\" \"Persistent Heartburn Is a Cancer Warning Sign,\" \"Two Drinks a Day Keep Stroke Away,\" \"Study: High-Fiber Diets Don't Cut Colon Cancer,\" and \"No Link Found Between Fat, Breast Cancer\" (19) . News headlines can be based on inconclusive evidence (e.g., \"may be\"), scare tactics (e.g., \"warning sign\"), disregard of details (e.g., the health risks of drinking, such as liver disease), and conflicting messages (e.g., reporting results that are different from numerous other studies).",

Consider the following scenario. Evidence relating cellular telephone use and brain tumors is still inconclusive, despite the multiple studies that have been done and the widespread attention given to the topic (21) . Assume the null hypothesis is true -that cellular telephone use does not cause brain tumors. In addition, assume that as a result of chance or bias (and not a high-quality study), some researchers report finding an association between cellular telephone use and brain tumors (a false-positive study). Publication of the false-positive study creates concern, and the problem becomes a hot topic (hot topic bias) which results in more studies -perhaps even 100 -that are designed to investigate the potential problem (22) . At the conventional significance level, or \u03b1 level, of .05, five of the 100 studies are expected to have positive results (23) ; in other words, five of the studies in this example would be expected to find that cellular telephone use causes brain tumors. The researchers who obtain positive results are more likely to document their results and submit papers to a journal (positive results bias), and journal editors are more likely to publish studies with positive results (editor's bias) (20) . In other words, the five positive studies (which are actually false-positive studies) are more likely to be published, and few of the other 95 studies that did not find an association between cellular telephone use and brain tumors will be published (publication bias). The five additional false-positive studies make the topic even more urgent in the research community, and the false-positive research cycle begins again as more studies are designed to assess the problem. Through this biased process, researchers can often \"prove\" something out of nothing.",

The study's methodology involved constructing 15 models of the posterior part of a natural dentition. The models had extracted teeth mounted in a medium with a radiodensity similar to that of human bone. Bitewing radiographs were taken of the simulated dentitions. The teeth used in the model mounts were removed from the models, serially sectioned, and examined with a microscope for caries. The results of the microscopic examination were established as the gold standard. Dentists were asked to read independently the 15 sets of bitewing radiographs and make treatment decisions about the teeth. The agreement between the dentists' readings and the gold standard established by the microscope results was poor (mean \u03ba = 0.35) (25).",

In a mass screening for colorectal cancer, Zheng et al evaluated the accuracy of occult blood testing, using rectoscopy as the gold standard for comparison (30) . Clinical and epidemiological data from 60,496 individuals were collected. It was found that of the 477 individuals who had colorectal cancer diagnosed by rectoscopy (the gold standard), 437 were identified as having colorectal cancer by the occult blood test. This corresponded to a test sensitivity of 92% (437/477), which indicated that the occult blood test was a good screening test for colorectal cancer. The results were submitted to a scientific journal, and comments from two reviewers were received. One reviewer was pleased with the study and recommended publication. The other reviewer pointed out a gross error in the calculations and mentioned \"work-up bias.\" According to the original paper on work-up bias, it is not an easy issue to address (31) . An appropriate mathematical procedure was subsequently developed to address the work-up bias (32) . Using the new procedure, the occult blood test sensitivity was recalculated to be 28%, indicating that it was not a good screening test for colorectal cancer (30) . Therefore, the proper analysis completely reversed the study's conclusion.",

For them, a relevant message would be that eliminating tobacco use for 1 year in Canada would save $16.5 billion and prevent 47,000 deaths per year (59) . This message may not be relevant to members of the general public who are not interested in policy and economics but are passionate about sports. Instead of telling them about how much society will save if they quit smoking, you could tell them how many important sports events, such as Stanley Cup hockey playoffs, World Cup international soccer games, or Super Bowl football playoffs, they would miss in their lifetime if they continued smoking (59) .",

The key is to create an atmosphere in which knowledge users are interested in and seeking out scientific knowledge rather than being inundated with unwanted information. Knowledge users can be motivated in many ways, and education plays an important role. Presenting facts is not enough. For example, after returning home from a doctor's office, a colleague's teenage son told her that his doctor told him he was obese. The boy then said that he really did not need to worry about the problem because obesity was so common. The boy had the facts but was not motivated to do anything about them.",

For example, mathematical prediction models could help policymakers evaluate how various policies will affect a particular situation. To help show the general public how scientific evidence can be used to make health decisions and improve their health, computer software could be used to calculate the probability of disease risks or overall health outcomes based on input related to personal lifestyle choices, demographics, diet, and smoking (20) . For example, a 20-year-old man in excellent health may find out that he is expected to live 75 years. The computer program could be used to show him that if he were to start smoking, he would only be expected to live 67 years (64) . The 8-year difference may be rewarding enough for him to decide not to start smoking.",
